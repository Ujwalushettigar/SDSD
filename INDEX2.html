    <h2>Cricket Overview</h2>
    <p>Cricket is one of the most popular and widely followed sports in the world, especially in countries like India, England, Australia, and Pakistan. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each. The game has three main formats: Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and T20s, with T20 being the shortest and most fast-paced. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team, and it involves skilled batting, strategic bowling, and sharp fielding. Cricket is not just a sport but a passion for millions, with iconic tournaments like the ICC World Cup, T20 World Cup, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) drawing huge global audiences. Legendary players like Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and AB de Villiers have inspired generations with their performances. Whether it's the tension of a last-over thriller or the pride of watching your national team win, cricket unites people across cultures and brings immense joy to its fans.
